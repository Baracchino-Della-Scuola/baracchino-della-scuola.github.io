This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Development
To develop edit files in src/*
## Scripts
THere are some scripts with `npm run` you can use:
- `npm run start` : start the dev server
- `npm run build` : compile the project with webpack
- `npm run test` : run eslint for linting
- `npm run eject` : eject the runner (irreversible action)
- `npm run show` : start the tailwindcss config viewer
# Installing
Just clone the repo and run `npm i` then start it like above (`npm start` or `npm run start`)
# Deploy
I personally use [Netlify](https://netlify.com) but you can use a webserver of your own, [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Firebase from Google](https://firebase.google.com/). There are some other alternatives but I tried these.
